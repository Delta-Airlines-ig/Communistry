# Communistry
An extremely work in progress mindustry mod that lets you build large industrial centers and use military tech (like tanks, soldiers, etc.) to destroy things. also based off of the USSR because yes.

be aware of bad sprites because im not good at that.

also, this mod isnt really meant to be used in a normal game because progression is very slow. use this in a pvp/attack game and make sure to ban vanilla turrets and units (although if your fast some of the units from this mod can shread through most early-mid game units).

also if you want to contact me for some reason (help with spriting?) then my discord is DeltaV#5205

also also written in json/hjson btw
